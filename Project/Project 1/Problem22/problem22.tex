\begin{overview}
\item [Algorithm:] Finding maximum clique in a given graph~(algo.~\ref{problem22}) 
	% - replace nb with problem number (e.g. problem101)
	% -	must match the label of the algorithm 
	% - for more than one algo list each of them and use problem101a, problem101b, problem101c etc.
\item [Input:] An undirected graph with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$.
\item [Complexity:] complexity of the algorithm, e.g. $\mathcal{O}(n)$
\item [Data structure compatibility:] Undirected Graphs.
\item [Common applications:] DNA computing, sociology studies, data mining.%most common fields where this algorithm is used
\end{overview}

\begin{problem}{\pbname}
	The clique problem is to find the maximum clique in a given undirected graph. A clique is defined as all nodes are connected to each other through an edge, namely a complete subgraph.
\end{problem} 

\subsection*{Description}
%Detailed description of the problem; More detailed information on the input and complexity; more applications with details on how they relate to each other (if this is the case).
 Suppose we have an undirected graph with a set of vertices and a set of edges, we wish to find a fully connected subgraph with maximum nodes, which is known as a \textit{maximum complete subgraph}. The input shall be the undirected graph. \\
 We will introduce a basic algorithm used to solve the clique problem, called \textbf{B\&B framework}. (Branch and Bound)
